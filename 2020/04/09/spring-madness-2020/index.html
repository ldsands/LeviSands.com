<h2 id="jumping-back-into-science-outreach">Jumping Back into Science Outreach!</h2>
<p>Every year, before the end of Winter Quarter, the City of San Diego hosts an event called the <a href="https://www.lovestemsd.org/">San Diego Festival of Science and Engineering</a>—or SDFSE for short. At EXPO Day, organizations from nearby universities and local companies host booths for attendees to visit. In previous years, I participated in EXPO Day with the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) and Bioengineering Graduate Society (BEGS) at UCSD. This year, I helped staff a booth hosted by the Graduate Bioinformatics Council (GBIC) and the Undergraduate Bioinformatics Club (UBIC) at UCSD!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Currently at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SDFSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SDFSE</a> for their annual Expo Day 2020!

<p>At our booth, we taught students basic concepts about the central dogma of biology, genetic inheritance, and genome sequencing—through some abstraction, of course. To do this, we prompted visitors to &ldquo;build a monster&rsquo;s DNA&rdquo; with colored lego blocks. After stacking the blocks into the monster&rsquo;s genome, we &ldquo;sequenced&rdquo; the DNA with our Arduino-built sequencing machine. Our machine had a laser that would translate each block&rsquo;s color to a given nucleotide in a fashion similar to Illumina sequencing machines. With the monster&rsquo;s DNA sequence, visitors could then determine their monster&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>While EXPO day was exhausting to participate in, seeing people get excited about genomics and bioinformatics was super rewarding.</p>
<h2 id="13th-annual-genetics-training-program-retreat">13th Annual Genetics Training Program Retreat</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a part of the Genetics Training Program at UCSD, and each year, the 5th year class organizes an annual retreat for the program filled with research talks and poster presentations. While the poster presentations are mandatory, I was excited to piece together my project&rsquo;s story for the first time in a scientific poster.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Presented my poster at the UCSD 13th Annual Genetics Training Program Retreat 🙌 Cheers to the first poster of graduate school 💗 Next time, I&#39;ll definitely include more pictures of Ciona ☺️ <a href="https://t.co/RATwQxdwzA">pic.twitter.com/RATwQxdwzA</a></p>&mdash; Michelle Franc Ragsac (@mragsac) <a href="https://twitter.com/mragsac/status/1237496753907044352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I presented on a project I worked on during my research rotation in <a href="https://farleylab.com/">Emma Farley&rsquo;s laboratory</a>—a project that convinced me to stay in the lab! In the lab, we&rsquo;re interested in studying early development using the model organism <em>Ciona intestinalis</em>. While previous studies have provided insight into how cells determine when and where they turn into different tissue types, we wanted to develop a better understanding of these processes. To do this, we used single-cell sequencing to figure out what genes are active in individual cells of a given tissue type during different time points of development.</p>
<p>For my project, I learned how to analyze the data using tools such as <a href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger"><code>cellranger</code></a> on the <code>UNIX</code> command line and <a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/"><code>Seurat</code></a> in the <code>R</code> programming language. Analyzing the data helped us discover genes that are specific to certain cell types but have a relatively unknown function in <em>Ciona</em>!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to finish up this project soon so that I can write it up to put on this website!</p>
<h2 id="covid-19-at-ucsd">COVID-19 at UCSD</h2>
<p>During an pneumonia outbreak investigation in Wuhan, China in late 2019, investigators discovered the emergence of a respiratory illness now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0121-novel-coronavirus-travel-case.html">January 21, 2020</a>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the first positive case in the United States from a patient that had recently traveled to Washington state from Wuhan. Following this, UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla sent out a notice on Valentine&rsquo;s Day about the university&rsquo;s dedication to safeguarding the health and wellness of its students, staff, and faculty. He also sent out a link to a website that would provide UCSD-specific updates about COVID-19: <a href="https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu/">https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu/</a>.</p>
<p>That happened during my <a href="https://ldsands.github.io/2020/03/01/winter-quarter-2020-update-health-student-activism/">last update</a>. While thoughts about the virus were at the back of my mind, I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to them. Just in case anything needed to happen, my lab came up with a strategy for how we would all work from home if need be, but none of us felt as if a shutdown would happen.</p>
<p>Things then started changing very rapidly at UCSD from the administrative end:</p>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="http://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2020/2020-3-11-1.html">March 11, 2020</a>, the university canceled all in-person, on-campus Winter Quarter 2020 final exams in favor of online final exams</li>
<li>On <a href="http://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2020/2020-3-13-3.html">March 13, 2020</a>, the university started encouraging non-essential personnel to work remotely</li>
<li>On <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf">March 19, 2020</a>, CA Governor Gavin Newsom placed a statewide &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; order</li>
<li>On <a href="http://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2020/2020-3-26-2.html">March 26, 2020</a>, the university mandated that all research must move as much activity as possible to an online setting with minimal numbers of on-site personnel</li>
<li>On <a href="http://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2020/2020-3-28-1.html">March 28, 2020</a>, a UCSD student tested positive for COVID-19</li>
<li>On <a href="http://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2020/2020-3-16-2.html">March 29, 2020</a>, the university encouraged students to move out of on-campus housing to enforce social distancing measures, and mandated that Spring Quarter 2020 be fully online</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently in my second week of Spring Quarter 2020, and it&rsquo;s been a little unsettling.</p>
<p>The university-wide transition to an online work environment hasn&rsquo;t been the most transparent for graduate students. Some students were allowed to work from home with no questions asked. Unfortunately, other graduate students were required to work on-campus despite feeling unsafe outside of their homes. While I don&rsquo;t have much faith in the university investigating how faculty and departments responded appropriately to COVID-19, I hope that something happens to improve the working conditions of students.</p>
<p>Luckily, I&rsquo;ve been working from home since March 13th due to personal choice, and while I&rsquo;m accustomed to working remotely, it&rsquo;s been difficult. As a bioinformatician, I rely on data hosted on some remote server, and crunching numbers is the norm. In a perfect world, I would work from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM with the occasional break for a walk outside or internet browsing. In a regular world without COVID-19, I prefer to work from &ldquo;home&rdquo;—instead of home, I prefer to work from a coffee shop or library. Working remotely is less distracting, and I find that I&rsquo;m more productive when I&rsquo;m removed from campus but still reachable online or over the phone.</p>
<p>But in this reality, I feel on edge, anxious, and fatigued. I read sentences over and over again, and I forget the correct syntax for coding more often than before. No matter how early I sleep, I never want to wake up in the morning. I&rsquo;m trying my best to complete tasks each day and stay productive, but it&rsquo;s harder than usual with all of the Zoom meetings. Luckily, I haven&rsquo;t been the only one feeling like this, and that in of itself is comforting.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these feelings dissipate in the coming days and we all feel a little less stressed!</p>

<p>Stay healthy everybody!</p>
