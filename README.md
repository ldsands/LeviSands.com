# Levi's Personal Blog (Academic Focus)

Here is the repository that I use to host my personal blog. This blog is much more focused on my academic and programming ventures.

I created this blog using [blog-o-matic by Pablo Iranzo](https://github.com/iranzo/blog-o-matic) which uses [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) with the [Elegant theme](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant) in conjunction with [Travis.ci](https://travis-ci.org/) to publish the blog.

The links for this blog are as follows:

- [Github Repo](https://www.github.com/ldsands/ldsands.github.io)
- [Travis-ci site](https://travis-ci.org/github/ldsands/ldsands.github.io)
- [Published site](https://ldsands.github.io)

## Things to Know

The content is hosted in markdown format for easy manipulation on the [`source`](https://github.com/ldsands/ldsands.github.io/tree/source) branch whereas the actual website is hosted on the [`master`](https://github.com/ldsands/ldsands.github.io/tree/master) branch. There shouldn't be any reason to modify the master branch.
